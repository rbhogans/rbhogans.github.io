   Lets start at the beginning. I did not realize how choices you make  can be a determing factor for how your life can potentially turn out. My career goal in life after highschool was to be happy and successful. Thats it, nothing more nothing less. I wasn't as serious as I shoulve, been back then. Not fine tuning this goal was like a double edge sword in a sense but I would  be here had it been  one path I suppose. Not doing so ultimatly  is how I ended up here and Godwilling will changed my life for the good.

     Anyways, my career path began when computer technology wasn't as accessible during my upbringing until after highschool. Mind you with that same goal untweaked not realizing this computer thing meant the world as I new it was going to change forever. As soon as technology did become accessible, it  drastically took over every aspect of life. I mean everything, from talking on the phoneto added texting and emailing daily not to mention, schooling fulltime.  By the way I love socializing so  naturally, the communicaton aspect of  computer technology quickly became  a passion. Communicating became so easy accross the nation.

     Since then, it seems computers were advancing yearly sometime within 6 months. So much so, any work experience I acquired required the use of computers extensively. In addition, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees solely online. So, I endulged in the rat race with the rest of America for a long minute but just maintaining mediocre jobs and a few degrees slowly came to a head. This is when I got tired of being tired and seriously revisited my life goals from the beginning of this race before go (start life began). Now fined tuned and tweeked the question was: WHAT DO YOU ULTIMATELY WANT OUT OF LIFE and WHAT CAREER MOVE WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY WITH A MODEST LIFESTYLE?

    It was this event that brought the thought to me that a career in computers would be a perfect fit for a career choice since computer savviness is a strength.  It would be ideal if these two worlds met. BUT HOW?  A career that uses my brain mostly is more conducive to my lifestyle. Since computers have always been apart of but not entirely, in my life, Making this career choice was a choice that I had been avoiding but it was always right in front of me from the beginning. I decided to do plenty of research to explore this passion through a lot of testimonials, blogs, and videos on google.  In a pursuit to fill this interest, after careful consideration, I chose web development as a good area in this field for me.  I decided to study Software Engineering with Flatiron to teach this new, world if you will, to me. SO HERE i AM!!!!
