 I got tired of being tired and seriously revisited my life goals from the beginning of this race before go (start life began). Now fined tuned and tweeked the question was: WHAT DO YOU ULTIMATELY WANT OUT OF LIFE and WHAT CAREER MOVE WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY WITH A MODEST LIFESTYLE?    Right then, the thought to me that a career in computers would be a perfect fit for a career choice since computer savviness is a strength.  BUT HOW was I going to bring my two worlds together HMMM?   A career that uses my brain mostly is more conducive to my lifestyle. Since computers have always been apart of but not entirely, in my life, Making this career choice was a choice that I had been avoiding but it was always right in front of me from the beginning. I decided to do plenty of research to explore this passion through a lot of testimonials, blogs, and videos on google.  In a pursuit to fill this interest, after careful consideration, I chose web development as a good area in this field for me.  I decided to study Software Engineering with Flatiron to teach this new, world if you will, to me. SO HERE i AM!!!!
